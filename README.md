# Connect4

Two Connect 4 games! one made in Java and the other in C.
both are text-based so it would just runs on your console.

pretty much the same thing but the java version has less bugs I think. 
C is not bad though because I made it look better then the Java version.

all the bugs these two have aren't real big ones and basically won't break.
