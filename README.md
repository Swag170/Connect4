# Connect4

Two Connect 4 games! One made in Java and the other in C.
Both are text-based so it would just run on your console.

Pretty much the same thing but the java version has less bugs I think. 
C is not bad though because I made it look way better then the Java version.

All the bugs these two have aren't real big ones and basically won't break.

C4Updated.c has its win checker {gameStillActive()} to be multithreaded!!!
And uses some pointers here and there.

C4V3.c is the fastest version and focusses on just being efficient with everything!
